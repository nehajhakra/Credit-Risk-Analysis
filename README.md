📊 Credit Risk Analysis using SQL & Python
🔍 Analyze loan approvals, customer transactions, and payment behaviors to assess credit risk.

🚀 Project Overview
Credit risk analysis is crucial for financial institutions to determine whether a customer is likely to repay loans on time or default. This project explores real-world banking data to extract insights using:
✔ SQL – For database creation, queries, and risk categorization.
✔ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – For data visualization and deeper analysis.


🔗 Repository Structure
📁 data/ – Contains raw datasets (customers.csv, loans.csv, transactions.csv, payments.csv).
📁 sql_queries/ – SQL scripts for database setup, queries, and insights.
📁 notebooks/ – Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
📁 visualizations/ – Saved plots and graphs generated from analysis.
📄 README.md – You're here!

📂 Datasets Used
Dataset	Description
customers.csv	Customer details (age, gender, income, employment type, credit score).
loans.csv	Loan details (loan type, amount, interest rate, approval status).
transactions.csv	Transaction history (amount, type, date).
payments.csv	Loan payment records (due dates, paid dates, statuses).

🔍 SQL Analysis – Key Insights
✅ Total Loan Amount & Average Interest Rate
✅ Loan Approval vs. Rejection Trends
✅ Customers Who Haven’t Taken Loans (LEFT JOIN)
✅ Credit Risk Categorization using CASE Statements
✅ Top 5 Borrowers (ROW_NUMBER Window Function)

📊 Python Data Analysis & Visualizations
📌 Key Findings from Data Analysis:
📈 Loan approval rates – Comparing different loan types.
📉 Customer age & income distribution – Who is more likely to borrow?
💰 Transaction trends – High-value vs. low-value transactions.
📊 Loan repayment trends – Who repays on time vs. who defaults?
